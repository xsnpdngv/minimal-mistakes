The definite relation between reality and a photograph is usually quite
problematic, however as something appears on a picture, it becomes credible.
People take huge number of photos on themes that have already been photographed
in a more ambitious way and these high standard, postcard-like pictures can
simply be downloaded from the internet. Being aware of this, somebody can be
led to take his own pictures on the grounds of justifying or visualizing his
relation to the theme or his presence. The purpose of the photographs in my
series are however different, as they do not visualize the presence of the
photographer, but the instantaneous coexistence of strange optical situations
that can be seen only from one particular point of view. The negatives of these
pictures as light-imprints of single exposures prove their genuinness against
digital imitation, yet these photographs seem to be unrealistic.
