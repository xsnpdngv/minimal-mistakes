{% include gallery caption="Found Things \| 2006" %}

Lost things and abandoned objects on public places can be
interesting not only from the point of view of who and why does not
need or miss them. This series approaches found things from
the question of visual interference and harmony with the original
environment where they were found, how they fade into or stand
out from those.
