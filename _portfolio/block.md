{% include gallery caption="Block \| Budapest, 2008" %}

Blocks of flats (blocks) are high-rise apartment buildings made of
prefabricated reinforced concrete elements. In Hungary, approximately 788.000
such flats were built to reduce postwar housing shortage and to slash costs by
employing uniform design. These flats still house over two million people,
one-fifth of the country's population. In most blocks, there are more than a
hundred flats with the same design, size and layout. Only the residents and
their home interiors make the difference between them - but from the outside,
these blocks all look the same. Standing in one's window and paying a lot of
attention to the block in front, the diversity and individuality of the
residents can slowly be portrayed even without seeing their faces.
